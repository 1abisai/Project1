<Project1>

The idea of this project was inspired by a relative who works as a mechanic for semi trucks. 
This website was made for the customers of the new mechanical service shop they're opening up.
My goal was to make a simple not overwhelming website since truck conducters are very busy.
Since the website is simple it'll allow them to schedule mechanical services quickly and effortlessy.
Aswell as encourage any customers to consider apply as a driver for the main company.
This project taught me to think from the perspective of customers.
